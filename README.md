# UK-Greenhouse-Gas-Analysis
Analysis project looking at the Greenhouse Gas emissions in the UK from 1990 to 2020. Data taken with permission from the ONS.gov.uk website. https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsatmosphericemissionsgreenhousegasemissionsbyeconomicsectorandgasunitedkingdom

About this Dataset
The emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydro-fluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride and total greenhouse gas emissions, by industry (SIC 2007 group â€“around 130 categories), UK, 1990 to 2020 and (provisional) 2021. 

Additional data downloaded from https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data. This data contains the timeseries ERA5(reanalysis) average annual temperature of the UK from 1950 -2020.

I will analyse the data using both PowerBI and Python to identify trends in the Greenhouse gas emissions within the UK. I will attempt tp answer the following questions:
1. Which industries listed in the data are the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions?
2. Within the the biggest contributors what subcategories are contributing the most greenhouse gases?
3. Are there any unusual or unexpected contributors to greenhouse gas emissions?
4. What key takeaways have I discovered in the data?
5. How much has the average temperature in UK changed over the time period covered?
6. Is there a correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and UK average temperatures?
